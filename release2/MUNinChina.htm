<h1>MUN in China</h1>
<p>As MUN conferences spring up worldwide, China has taken a world stage in the spreading of MUN conferences around the Asian continent.
    As different conferneces have emerged, there have been different types of MUN procedures, most notably the THIMUN, UNA/USA, and UN4MUN 
    style debate procedures. Although Chinese conferences has certified itself to a debate standard known to most as the Peking University 
    National Model United Nations (PKNMUN) debate procedures (北京大学全国中学生模拟联合国大会 学术标准手册), it resembles stark similarities to those
    of THIMUN procedures. The most probable difference is the consistent presence of the Main Press Center (MPC) at MUN conferences in China. The 
    MPC is a press center where "journalists" make up either ficitious information that could effect a committee's session, or just a published article 
    on the progress of each committee in the conference. It serves as an additional committee in the conference, but acts like a marketing department of a conference. 
</p>

<h2>Historical Committees</h2>
<p>Special committees can include a variety of different types, as the only limit is your imagination. There are committees like the Antarcitic commission, Mars Convention, 
    the East Asian Security Council, or the Space Council that are fictious or just merley out of the spectrum of United Nations committees and bodies but still serve as an integral part of the MUN conference.
    In China, the most prevelant and widely used special committee, or even committee in general, is the historical committee. the historical committee means exactly the same as 
    it sounds: it is a committee or council that existed in the past, or is set in the past. Examples of historical committees include the Cuban Missile Crisis, the League of Nations, 
    or the Trusteeship Coucnil. Historical committees help delegates revisit past events, but the session these delegates conduct are not bound to the actual historical events that occurred. 
    What this means is that if, for example, the historical commmittee session was the Trusteeship Council, the committee could divert from the actual resolution passed in the "real" 
    Trusteeship Council. The wide adoption of historical committees in China is directly correlated to the local and national politically-engaged policies that exist in China. For most 
    large scale conferences (roughly over 200 people) that are hosted in mainland China need to be pre-approved by the local government. MUN conferences, as engaging and fun they can be, are extremley 
    politically sensitive. In an extremely political sensistive and protective country like China, Model UN could pose a threat to the established government. Due to this, over the past few years, 
    there have been a considerable amount of cases where MUN conferences were cancelled to the contentious nature of its topic. Historical committees are great solutions to this kind of issue, as delegates 
    debate on what has already happened in the past, rather than a political issue that is occurring right now. Historical committees are more "role-play" compared to actual topics or committees in this 
    current political climate. Hence, it poses little to no political threat or contention.

<h1>The Regions of Chinese Model United Nations conferences</h1>
<p>
while MUN is a universal common activity everywhere, regions form cliques. This is not an MUN phenomenon per se, but instead, one that is more societal. In China, MUN is mostly divided by three regions, 
Northern China, Central China, and Southern China. The differences do not span in relation to the Model UN rules themselves, but are purley on who goes to what conferences. People in southern China participate in MUN 
conferences located in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, while people in Central China attend conferences in Shanghai or Nanjing.
