<p>The following are resources regarding Model United Nations and specifics on the guidelines</p>
<h2>Common Points and Motions</h2>
<h3>Point of Information</h3>
<p>After a delegate has given a speech in formal debate, he or she may yield time to points of information, or questions from other delegates concerning the speech. If the delegate believes their question hasn’t been answered or it could be further clarified, delegates can ask for a follow-up, however, the follow-up question must be relevant to the original point of information. (usually during sessions follow-ups to the second degree are not tolerated.)
</p>

<h3>Point of Personal Priviledge</h3>
<p>Points of personal privilege are used to inform the chairperson of a physical discomfort a delegate is experiencing, such as the inability to hear another delegate’s speech. If delegates want to go to the restroom they do not need to use this point. Delegates can simply give their lanyards to a runner/admin staff in the committee room and retrieve it once they come back. 
</p>

<h3>Point of Order</h3>
<p>Points of order are used when delegates believe the chair has made an error in the running of the committee. Delegates rising to points of order may not speak on the substance of the matter under discussion. They should only specify the errors they believe were made in the formal committee procedure. 
</p>
 
<h3>Point of Parliamentary Inquiry/Procedure</h3>
<p>When the floor is open (i.e. no other delegate is speaking), a delegate may rise to a point of inquiry in order to ask the chairperson a question regarding the rules of procedure.
</p>

<h3>Motion to Set the Agenda</h3>
<p>This motion is raised by a delegate at the beginning of the first session, to get the debate started by setting an agenda—meaning determining as a committee which topic to debate first. 
    Ex. “The delegate of [country name] sets a motion to place [topic A] first on the agenda, followed by [topic B].” 
    </p>

<h3>Motion to Add Points of Information to the Speaker’s List</h3>
<p>Extends the number of questions to be asked a speaker. While raising this motion, please specify how many more points of information you propose to add. The delegate raising the motion is automatically entitled to the first point of information.</p>

<h3>Right of Reply</h3>
<p>If a delegate insults another delegate’s country, the delegate may use “right of reply.” When used, you may defend themselves and demand an apology. </p>

<h3>Motion to Open/Close the Speakers List</h3>
<p>Makes a list of all delegates wishing to take the floor and deliver a speech. Only speakers on the list may speak, unless it is opened again. The order on the list is the order that the delegates will speak in. The motion requires a simple majority vote.</p>

<h3>Motion to Suspend Debate and Move into Moderated/Unmoderated Caucus</h3>
<p>Suspending the meeting means calling for a moderated (a type of informal debate where the chairs call on delegates one at a time to make a speech) or unmoderated caucus (a second type of informal debate that is much like lobbying & merging). When moving to suspend the meeting, delegates should specify the purpose for and length of the suspension. This motion requires an immediate vote. 
    Ex. “Motion to suspend debate and move into [time] minutes of moderated caucus addressing [topic], with a speaker’s time of [time] seconds.”</p>

<h3>Motion to Adjourn Meeting</h3>
<p>Adjourning the meeting ends the committee session until the next session, which may be held the following year. The motion is most commonly made to end a committee session for the purpose of lunch or dinner. It requires an immediate vote. </p>

<h3>Motion to Move to Voting Procedures</h3>
<p>Skips the remainder of the debate and moves the committee directly into the voting process. This motion concludes debate on the subject at hand, whether it is on an amendment or resolution.</p>

<h3>Motion to Divide the House</h3>
<p>If there are enough abstentions to make a difference in voting results, this motion forces all those who have abstained to vote “for” or “against.” This could potentially change the results of the previous vote.</p>
