<p>Honorable Chairs and Esteemed Delegates! My name is Marco Nie and I am a sophomore at Babson College! I am an Japanese born Chinese, and I live in the bright city of Shenzhen! 
    I have been invovled in Model United Nations since early middle school, and I have been very passionate
    about the subject ever since. <br />
    <img src="Marco1.jpeg" alt="marco" class="marco" width=10% onload="slide()" id="img">
    Yet, the passion didn't come that smoothly, I started MUN as a blank slate, not knowing where to start my research,
    how to debate, or even the procedures during the first conference that I attended in 2014 at Shenzhen. The conference was called 
    ACAMUN and I was in a General Assmelby 2 (GA2) committee as the deleegation of Libya.  I vividly recall our contention
    to be about trying to lower the national debt of Lower Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs). I didn't understand even a word
    that was being uttered by my fellow delegates. My then introverted and timid style didn't serve me too well in a participation-intensive, high volatility conference. I couldn't even decipher how committee operations and basic rules and procedures worked!
    I ended up finishing this conference not having spoken once in a moderated caucus, nor did I contribute once in the joint resolution that I
    blindly co-sponsored. In general, Model UN seemed, back then, a extra-curricualr activity I would never want to touch again.</p>



<p>It was not before my participation as the delegate of North Korea during my second partiicpating conference, where I somehow gained
an unwavering confidence in the debate stage. Perhpas it was the irregular audacity I naturally gained from the role of being the representative to 
the infmaous hermit kingdom of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, this completley 180 degree change in viewpoint to this extra-curricular activity 
made me realize how fun MUN was. This confernece, only a couple of months after my first disastrous experience with MUN, was the pivtoal moment when I decided 
to dedicate the rest of my high school career to Model United Nations.

<h2>What MUN is</h2>
<hr />
<p>MUN, also called "Model United Nations," is a debate-style conference where participants 
    take the role of delegations who represent different countries, organizations, and political bodies.
    Delegates are tasked with solving a issue that is presented to them, and they, using a form of debating procedure, 
    discuss about the issues and eventually come up with a set of solutions known as a &quot;resolution&quot;. MUN, as a student 
    activity, was formed as a platform where students can discover a interest in global politics and international relations.
