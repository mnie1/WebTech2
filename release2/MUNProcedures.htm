    <h1>The Rules and Procedures of Model UN</h1>
<p>A very key empahsis that Model UN tries to solidify in every one of its conferences is the maintenance of order in the debate stage. Sometimes, during a debate, participants can get very excited. It may 
    be about because another delegate's point of view may have differed from yours, or that there was just something very funny that someone said. Regardless of whether these anomalies are positive or negative in attitude, 
    they can distract the committee from focusing on the actual topic at hand. In an effort to maintain such professionalism, it has been widely accepted that Model UN follow certain debate procedures. The three most common ones 
    are UNA/USA style (or commonly known as North American style), THIMUN style, and the most recent of which, is UN4MUN style of procedure. In this page, we'll take a deeper look at THIMUN and UNA/USA style procedures.</p>


<h2>Robert's Rules of Order</h2>
<p>Most parliamentary style debates, those that are utilized in actual ogvernmental parliament, council, and congress, uses some form of the Robert's Rules of Order as the foundation or rule book during their debate. All of Model UN's 
    debate styles have originated from Robert's Rules of Order because they are highly influenced by the United Nations' way of conducting debate sessions. When viewing the MUN debate procedures, you will realize there are a lot of similarities if not 
    direct copies of rules from the Robert's rules. 
</p>

<h2>The Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN) Debate Procedure</h2>
<p>This is perhaps the most common form of debate procedure utilized by most delegates around the world. THIMUN could be considered the "easy version" of MUN as most of its conferences, along with the style itself, are relatively friendly. THIMUN procedures are the same as UNA/USA styles only to the extent 
    of how delegates should conduct themselves. Some of these include not laughing during session, only speaking when you have the floor, and no direct coversation between delegates are allowed. Of course, there must be someone who needs to be present to 
    enforce these rules and procedures. These "enforcers" are known as "chairs". There are usually two chairs, a President Chair and a Co-chair, who are present in every committee in order to guide the conference and make sure the delegates debating are following the rules and procedures of the conference. 
    However, the most important aspect of why THIMUN procedures are friendly is because they guide the conference sessions with a more fixed schedule. THIMUN procedures are most notable for their distinction of the first day of conference, which consists of policy debate (presentation of opening speeches) and 
    lobbying and merging (mandatory unmoderated caucus to draft resolutions and form blocs). In other procedures, delegates are usually the ones who must decide, through simple majority and calls to motion, what happens during a session. Therefore, we could say that THIMUN procedures have more fixed structures which means less 
    freedom, while other MUN procedures give more freedom to the participants in the session. Another key reason why THIMUN conferneces are friendly is because conferences who adopt THIMUN procedure technically are not allowed to give out awards. Hence, these THIMUN styled conferences are really good for beginner delegates.
</p>
<p>Notable MUN conferences that use THIMUN procedure include all of the THIMUN conferences, BEIMUN, CISSMUN. </p>
<h2>UNA/USA Style Debate Procedure</h2>
<p>UNA/USA stands for United Nations Association/United States of America MUN procedure. UNA/USA utilizes a much more choice for the delegates on what to do during a session. Sessions usually start if not alwyas on a motion. Motions are directives that a delegate proposes that the committee should do. There are a range of items on 
    what motions are available, but these motions are the fundamental basis as to how UNA/USA style debates function. This debate style is also the one that most resembles that of the United Nations. It is often noted that UNA/USA style debates are catered for more advanced committees, where delegates have a keen understanding of the 
    jargon of MUN as well as how motions work. This is the reason why, for most conferences, UNA/USA styles are reserved for the Security Council, which is often times the ultimate most difficult committee in an MUN confernece.
</p>
<p>Notable MUN conferences that use UNA/USA style procedure include Harvard MUN, Harvard WorldMUN, Yale MUN, Cornell MUN Confernece.</p>
