    <h1 id="toggle">First Time Participating in MUN?</h1>
<p id="1">Participating in MUN is a challenging task, especially if you are just starting. For me personally, I barley spoke during the first time I participated in MUN. In this page, I'll give some easy tips to 
    help you solidify your stance and prepare you if this is your first time participating!

<h2>Research Thoroughly</h2>
<p>It's all about knowing things you otherwise wouldn't care about when you are up at the debate stage. Research is only as good as if you actually remember it. Don't treat researching the topic or your country's stance as 
    a school assignment. It is best to think of MUN as merely just a game, and that, as fake representing a country, you are just in MUN to roleplay. Research should be done to the fullest extent to which you can defend yourself from 
    other delegate's if they choose to attack you. The best way to do this, also, is to research the stance of the countries in your committee. Make sure you know what rights and wrongs they have done and identify which of them are your 
    friends and which ones are foes in the international relations of the topic being debated. If you don't know yet, get a quick sense of what your country is as well as, and most importantly, your stance in the topic at hand. This form of 
    research is typically done by all delegates on what is known as the Position Paper. The Position Paper is a three paragraph, roughly one-page paper that outlines a basic introduction of the topic, what your country or the UN has done in the past to solve 
    this issue, and finally, the solutions you as the delegate of your country propose could solve the problem. The third paragraph, which is a draft solution, should be the most important compononet of your research. Other than that, there isn't much you can 
    research about because MUN is not about who knows the most information, but instead about who can utilize the available information to pass a resolution.
</p>

<h2>Unwavering Confidence</h2>
<p>If there is one thing I want anyone to take out of my experinece as a delegate in Model UN is to have a lot of confidence, to the point where it can be considered blind confidence. Most people who participate in seemingly difficult discussions, like MUN, would defer 
    their own opinions or not say them out loud for the mere reason of not wanting to be humiliated. Humiliation does take a huge psychological and emotional toll on us, but it is that inner barrier that prevents you from being a great delegate. There was a time inmy 
    MUN career where I was talking about something that made almost no sense, and people ate it up like it was true. The people sitting next to you in the committee room are not geniuses, and they certaintly don't have photographic memories of all the news that were reported 
    in the past five years that would contradict your statement you just made about the topic at hand. If you think you know little about what you are talking about or what the topic is about in general, chances are, everyone else doesn't too. It's best to put yourself out there 
    and act as confidently as possible. The delegates are people after all. They are not convinced by the amount of research you did about the topic being discussed, they are more swayed by the charismatic attitude you had in your previous impromptu speech. 
</p>

<h2>Have Drafted Speeches</h2>
<p>
It's hard for a first time delegate to engage in debate. If you are unable to be confident on the debate stage, it is okay to bring a piece of paper with a prewritten speech during your speech sessions. In fact, most people have a pre-written speech for their opening speeches during 
policy debate sessions. Although later on during the debate, when delegates have only mere seconds to come up with speeches, inquiries, or follow-ups, impromptu speaking would be the most important asset you could have in your arsenal.
</p>
<p>Tip: for impromptu speeches, they don't last more than 90 seconds. So the best way to do it is to structure it like a conversation. Do not think of impromptu speeches as "speeches". Instead think of impromptu speeches are just speaking to the committee.</p>
