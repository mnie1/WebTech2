    <h1>The Case for Online MUN conferences</h1>
<p>As COVID-19 has decimated our way of life and most places' ability to go to host major conferences offline. Naturally, there has been a surge in online MUN conferences worldwide. Online conferences have been a great alternative against offline conferences in 
    the past because of how you don't need to travel to get to one place to another. The online presence makes availability a very easy issue. Yet, participation in online MUN conferences have decreased dramatically during COVID-19. Why is this happening? Is participating 
    in online MUN conferences a good or bad idea?
</p>

<h2>Why Online MUN Conferences Are Not Worth It</h2>
<p>Online MUN conferences have actually existed for a while, especially with the presence of an organization called "O-MUN", which literally stands for "Online Model United Nations". This organization has been using a software specifically designed for MUN conference use to 
    conduct their online conferences. Ever since their inception, conferences online have been very decentralized and overall participation per committee is roughly less than 10 people (in comparison to more than 30 in offline conferences). This lack fo participation makes the online conference very boring to attend 
    and motivation to "win" the debate is no longer present. Furthermore, the cameras are turned-off, so it's impossible to see the other delegates or chairs, which decreases the professionalism that you would normally experienece in an MUN confernece. 
    Nowadays, with the Coronavirus outbreak, conference applications like zoom and tecent meetings were introduced into the MUN community. While this is a better application compared to previous used applications for conferneces, delegates just don't feel like sitting in your house wearing a suit 
    and making speeches via online meeting software is necessarily a good experience. It is the same when it comes to reasons as to why some students prefer to take offline classes rather than online classes, it's because of the feel that offline classes have.

<h2>The Case For Online Conference?</h2>
<p>Online conferences can be a bummer, but why would it still be a good idea to attend an online MUN conference? of course, first off, online MUN conferences do not have any barriers in terms of distance and location. Hence, any issues like visa or financial difficulties wouldn't be a problem for participants of online 
    MUN conferences. Secondly, since the committees do not require additional costs to host venue locations, online MUN conferences can host as many people as they want. Hence, there is technically no limit to how many people actually participate in online conferences. This is a great way for beginner delegates to hone their 
    skills and practice participating in MUN conferences. This is also a great time for beginner chairs to chair committees because there is a  low barrier of entry for online MUN conferences, which gives beginners a good chance to participate as a chair in MUN conferences. While your experience wouldn't be as desirable as that of offline 
    conferences, the cost of participation is also very low, to the point where it may only cost a cup of coffee to participate in a prestigious online MUN conference. Hence, these boundaries that would otherwise be a major component of a person's lack of participation in MUN conference do not exist in an online MUN community, giving participants a myriad of opportunities 
    to explore in terms of MUN.
