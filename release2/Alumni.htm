<p>Testimonies from former participant(s) of MUN</p>
<h2>Linda--Former Deputy Secretary General and Chair at U2NESCO</h2>
<p>
    I think MUN is a great tool for students to use to help prepare them for the real-world. I started joining Model UN when I wa a freshman in high school.
    At first, I wasn't really sure what to expect of MUN. But slowly I got to meet a lot of friends from other schools and cities.

<h2>Momo--Former delegte at PPRDMUN</h2>
<p>I went to MUN at first as a fun activity because my friends went as well. When we were finished with the MUN, I realized that I learned a lot about politics 
    gobally and about presenting fast pace.
